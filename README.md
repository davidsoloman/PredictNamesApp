# What Would Your Name Be If You Were Born in a Different Year?
## A Shiny App

This app explores the `babynames` data set from the Social Security Administration. The user chooses a name (for male or female children) for one year, and the app finds names for another year that are similar in popularity, both in magnitude and slope. Check out [the app](https://juliasilge.shinyapps.io/PredictNamesApp/).

In the app, you choose
* the sex of the name
* the name to find comparisons for
* the original year
* a target year to find similar names in
